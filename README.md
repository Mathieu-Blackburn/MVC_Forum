# MVC_Forum
A Model-View-Controller forum made in ASP.Net Core using Identity

**This was a solo school project**

To run this project, you need to run the Database Script on a server. 
It was made for SQL Express 2019 but you can change the connection string in 'appsettings.json' inside the project root folder.
When you run the debugger inside Visual Studio it should then connect to the Database and run without hiccups.

This project features a forum with categories, questions and answers. It uses Identity to figure out which user is connected and act accordingly.
It also uses little addons like TinyMCE in textareas to be a bit more fun.

The credentials used are:

    Username: Admin
    Password: Pa$$w0rd
    
All the other 'Users' on the site have the same password, if you want to compare.

Don't pay too much attention to the site's theme
